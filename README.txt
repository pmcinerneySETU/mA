# Welcome to the mementoArtem Digital Street Art Archive project!!

CCCC The mementoArtem digital street art project is a web-enabled digital archive of public and community street art. The system, using the Arches platform and the CIDOC-CRM ontology, is being developed in conjunction with the INSYTE-Cooley research group (Centre for Information Systems and Techno-Culture), South East Technological University, Waterford, Ireland. Close-range photogrammetry and color-calibrated orthography are being used to visually record the works. The mementoArtem project involves multidisciplinary collaboration with a number of internal and external partners, including artists, technologists and community groups.
